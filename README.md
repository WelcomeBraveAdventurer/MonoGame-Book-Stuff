# MonoGame-Book-Stuff

Welcome to the GitHub repository that accompanies the book A Gamer's Introduction to MonoGame: Welcome Brave Adventurer.

In this repository, you'll find:

* all the assets used in the book
* starter projects for the level examples and the code quests
* completed project for the level examples and the code quests

If you download these files you will need to unblock dotnet-tools.json before you can compile and run the MonoGame examples. See Bonus Level 1 - Let's take this online in the book for more instructions.

Finally, this respository is still a work in progress - the book has many, many examples. If there is something missing or something not working properly, please reach out to the email address that can be found at https://welcomebraveadventurer.ca
